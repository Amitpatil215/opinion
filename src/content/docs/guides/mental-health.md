Abundance of metrics and statistics does more harm than good.

You might have thought of why she isn't replying me, even if she in online. I sent her message at x O clock, and her last seen updated to x+1 O'clock and she chose to be online but didn't replied me. 

He read my message, I can see those blue ticks but didn't replied to me. all these things fundamentally tries to compare your effort vs other persons effort.

While it's true it does more harm than good, it tickles every other day you mental health, I highly recommend switching of online, last seen, delivered receipts on every social media app out there. It's not cause you don't wanna show yours, It's cause you don't wanna see others.

More ignorant you are, more at peace you will be. Stalking, looking into partner's phone guessing assessing, kills you mental peace.  

Stop watching news, stop listening to emotional poetries, stop watching motivational content, stop reading quotes. This is a bubble and more of a tutorial hell.
