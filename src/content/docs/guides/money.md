Money is a leverage, so what time. In life you will always juggle between having more money and having more time. When you have less money you spend ur time in-order to research, bargain while buying things. and when your time values increases you spend money to get time. Be it going for vacation, or choosing cab over walk.

Having abundance of money may not necessarily make you happy, but having less money defiantly bring sorrow.

In order to get other leverages like time and health, money helps.
