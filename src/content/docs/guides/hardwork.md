title: Hard work | Luck | Success

**Life is all about being at the right place at the right time.** Hard work doesn't always pay back, and fundamentally, we have to understand that nobody owes us anything. Just because you studied day and night doesn't mean the examiner owes you good marks; just because you loved somebody doesn't mean they owe you love back; just because you graduated, doesn't mean companies owe you a job.

So it's important in life to be lucky more often than right. I personally feel that **99.9% of the time, I have been lucky in life**, and it has had very little to do with my hard work but rather much to do with the place I'm at, the people I met. And this is a numbers game; you're going to win half of the time and lose half of the time, just to maintain two sides of the coin. But one should strive to win early on in life so that they can create a cushion for themselves to fall upon when time and luck aren't in their favor.
