üï∂Ô∏è Plan in decades live in moments 
Its a strange feeling of having all the time in the world but running out of time at the same time.

It's bang on. zooming out of the current moment gives you a wide perspective of how you want to plan your life and then zooming in to smell the roses. Ykwim

I hope each & everyone of you take the time to enjoy the little things, because one day you may look back and realise they were the big things
